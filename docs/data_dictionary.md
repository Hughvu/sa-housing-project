- **Derived** — transparent calculation from source fields.
- **Proxy** — calculation approximating a concept it does not directly measure.
- **Scenario** — conditional future value based on assumptions.

## Decision Explorer runtime fields and exports

The explorer evaluates rules at runtime from `dashboard_lga_pressure.csv`; it
does not add a new processed score. Ruleset `sa-housing-screening-v1` version
`1.0` adds derived match, reason, component-explanation and ranking-status
fields in memory.

The auditable CSV is one row per local area and rule. Its exact fields are:

| Field group | Fields | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Ruleset | `Ruleset_ID`, `Ruleset_Version`, `Rule_ID`, `Rule_Name`, `Question`, `Expression` | Derived metadata |
| Evaluation | `Matched`, `Evaluation_Reason`, `Permitted_Interpretation`, `Pressure_Ranking_Status`, `Evidence_Gap_Reason` | Derived |
| Identity | `LGA_Name` | Observed copy |
| Existing score | `Housing_Pressure_Index`, `Housing_Pressure_Category`, `Affordability_Pressure_Score`, `Demand_Pressure_Score`, `Supply_Gap_Score` | Derived copy |
| Raw evidence | `Rent_to_Income_Proxy_Pct`, `Population_Growth_Pct`, `Population_Change`, `Approvals_per_1000`, `Approvals_2024_25`, `Other_Residential_Approval_Share_Pct`, `Total_Count`, `Sample_Quality` | Existing proxy, observed and derived copies |
| Driver explanation | `Highest_Index_Component`, `Highest_Component_Score`, `Highest_Component_Is_Tied` | Derived |
| Full-reference benchmarks | `Reference_Population_Growth_Median_Pct`, `Reference_Approvals_per_1000_Median`, `Reference_Complete_LGA_Count` | Derived from all 53 complete scored areas |
| Audit context | `Source_Periods`, `Fixed_Limitations` | Versioned metadata |

Rules may match non-exclusively. The growth/approval benchmark fields use the
full scored reference cohort and do not change with UI filters. Positive
shortlists are ordered by existing HPI only; Evidence gaps are never ranked.
See [`decision_explorer.md`](decision_explorer.md) for the complete contract.

## Geography coverage

The 71 records in `dashboard_lga_pressure.csv` are ABS-coded local areas: 68
incorporated LGAs and three Unincorporated SA statistical areas. `LGA_Code` and
`LGA_Name` follow the ABS source nomenclature. “71 local areas” therefore does
not mean 71 councils.

## Interpretation rule

The Housing Pressure Index ranks LGAs against one another for the input periods.
It does not measure the probability of shortage, identify causality, estimate
unmet dwelling need, or determine whether an individual household is in stress.
